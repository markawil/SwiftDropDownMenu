# SwiftDropDownMenu

Here's a basic example of a drop down menu that hides under the nav bar, and a slide out menu that is not an entire view controller.

Selecting the buttons in the drop down will swap out the viewControllers, so in a sense this is an alternative to using the standard UITabController.
